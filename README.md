ðŸ”§ Electron-based Scratch Import Fixer app for Windows

This project is based on the [web-based Scratch Import Fixer](https://github.com/micahlt/scratchimportfixer), but has been transferred to a Node-based Electron app.  It also enables fixing files directly in the File Explorer right-click menu.
